# C.O.S.M.O.S.
A 3D-based mapping and representation of our observable universe.

Based and inspired from the same concept of Google Earth, Maps, and Street View. C.O.S.M.O.S., in essence, is a platform that provides a 3D reprsentation and mapping of locations throughout our observable universe. This could be accomplished by our current space telescopes and along with some emergent and later, future satellite imagery and tech. Along with 3D, me along with a future team and collaborators could someday implement higher dimensions of viewing providing new visual perceptions and perspectives (e.g 4D, 5D, etc). With the advent of emergent and future technologies, that is.

Similar to how Google Earth utilizes geographic information system (GIS) consists of integrated computer hardware and software that store, manage, analyze, edit, output, and visualize geographic data, something simliar or akin can be developed in order to provide clear representation of certain regions and sectors in space.


IPFS (Interplanetary File System) can work intagent with Github. So utilised this repositors (and branches thereof) is also ideal with the site.

The program/platform will utilize: AI, machine learning, deep learning, Self-Improving Algorithm.
Among such, a fairly powerful AI is needed to do most of the heavy lifting--sorting, processing info, running repetitive tasks.

I thank God first for the technological/engineering prowess that is endowed into man's capability to allow this to be possible. Second, Keyhole, Inc. and Google for the inception and implemenation of the map-based service(s) and program we all know.
